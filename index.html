        <p>Welcome to my Website!</p>
        <img src="https://content.codecademy.com/articles/github-pages-via-web-app/happy-ice-cream.gif"/>
        <p>This is just my learning page. I created this as a template and with instructions from
            Github. I will aim to update this website as I learn more and more.
